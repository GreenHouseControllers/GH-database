###### To do request to the db, you have to send object like:
    {
       method: "readJson",
       path: "a/b/c",
       name: "exemple.txt"
    }

##### Methods
1. readFile - read file and return its contents.
2. createFile - create file and return message or error.
3. removeFile - remove file and return message or error.
4. readJson - read and parse json file and return its contents.
5. createDir - create folder and return message or error.
6. removeDir - remove folder and return message or error.
7. writeFile - write data to file and return message or error. 

To write file, first you have to create a variable or object - data

let data = 'some text'

##### or
    let data = {
    	name: "jack",
    	age: "16",
    }

##### Then send:
    {
        "method": "writeFile",
        "path": "exemple",
        "name": "exemple.json",
        "data": data
    }

if you got message like 'Can not read file' and error, look for errors of the fs.

            "syscall": "mkdir",
            "path": "/home/glab/Рабочий стол/Glab/jarvis/DB/1.0/DB/db/file_sistem/exemple"
